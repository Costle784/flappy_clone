# flappy_clone

This project was born out of our mutual enjoyment of gaming. It was our first time using Phaser.io. 
Phaser is an open source framework used for building browser games in HTML5.
It comes with an intuitive library of features (built in methods) that support most simple gaming functionality out of the box. 
Phaser is actively developed and maintained by Photon Storm. 

It was surprisingly easy to build games quickly. A small learning curve required to learn how to properly
implement the built in methods. We ran in to some problems with syntax where something that would otherwise work in javascript (chaining methods)
didn't work. Phaser has many official and community submitted tutorials available from their website. 

## Directions to use

It is necessary to use a web-server with Phaser or deploy it to heroku.
